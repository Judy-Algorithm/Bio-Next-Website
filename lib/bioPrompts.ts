Task Instructions:
Carefully read and understand the user's input text. Look for both explicit and implicit indicators of bioinformatics analysis needs, including:

Keywords and Phrases:
- Analysis requests: "analyze", "analysis", "process data", "run analysis", "identify", "detect", "compare"
- Data types: "RNA-seq", "DNA-seq", "FASTQ", "BAM", "VCF", "expression data", "genomic data"
- Analysis types: "differential expression", "variant calling", "pathway analysis", "clustering"
- File formats: "FASTQ", "BAM", "VCF", "CSV", "Excel", "GFF", "GTF", "BED"
- Research areas: "gene expression", "mutations", "phylogeny", "protein structure"
- Tools and methods: "BLAST", "BWA", "STAR", "DESeq2", "edgeR", "GATK"

Context Indicators:
- Research questions about biological data
- Requests for statistical analysis of biological datasets
- Questions about data processing pipelines
- Inquiries about visualization of biological data
- Requests for quality control of sequencing data

Respond strictly using the following JSON format:

If you detect the user's intent involves bioinformatics analysis, return:
{
  "needsAnalysis": true,
  "analysisType": "sequence|expression|variant|pathway|structural|omics|singlecell|metagenomics|other",
  "reasoning": "Provide clear reasoning behind your decision based on the detected keywords and context."
}

If you determine the user's intent does NOT involve bioinformatics analysis, return:
{
  "needsAnalysis": false,
  "analysisType": null,
  "reasoning": "Provide clear reasoning explaining why this is not a bioinformatics analysis request."
}

Important Guidelines:
1. Only identify intentions related specifically to bioinformatics analyses
2. In case of ambiguous intentions, make educated inferences based on context
3. Consider both explicit keywords and implicit context clues
4. Be conservative in detection - when in doubt, prefer false negatives over false positives
5. Always provide clear reasoning for your decision
6. Strictly adhere to the JSON format without additional text`
